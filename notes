TO DO LIST:

Change on the board
[] - Implement a DB-9 on the board
  With a DB9 we will be able to have V +/-, GND and the outputs:
    HP filter, LFP filter, Amplification, Envelope, LP fixed
    And the offset input


[] - Make a new board that will be soldered (and use the offset) of the Adafruit Trinket M0
[] - The inputs of those boards don't need to DB, but it will be good to have it set up to install if people want to use
[] - The potentiometer has to be soldered on to the board
[] - The outputs for checking the filters can be headers
[] - We can put a manual switch to select if we want to add offset from trinket

Helpers for beginners
[] - Make a small tutorial explaining how filters work and what is a cut frequency
[] - Link a page for calculating filters and components you need if you want to filter different frequencies


Points about the Trinket M0
[] From adafruit website: A lot of people end up using charge-only USB cables and it is very frustrating! So make sure you have a USB cable you know is good for data sync.

For the GUI
[] Write the file to disk or to RAM?
[] Put the option of estimation of threshold?
