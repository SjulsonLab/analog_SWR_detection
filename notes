TO DO LIST:

Change on the board
[] - Implement a DB-9 on the board
  With a DB9 we will be able to have V +/-, GND and the outputs:
    HP filter, LFP filter, Amplification, Envelope, LP fixed
    And the offset input


[] - Make a new board that will be soldered (and use the offset) of the Adafruit Trinket M0

Helpers for beginners
[] - Make a small tutorial explaining how filters work and what is a cut frequency
[] - Link a page for calculating filters and components you need
