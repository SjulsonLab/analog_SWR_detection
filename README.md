# Analog SWR detection

This repository contains the schematics and PCB design of a circuit that implements a set of filters for sharp wave-ripple detection. It consists of a band-pass filter followed by an envelope low-pass filter. 

The circuit includes the possibility of offsetting the signal to use with the analog-digital converters of microcontrollers and microprocessors (Arduino and Raspberry Pi).

By adapting the components of this circuit you can adapt to detect other events, such as gamma oscillations or spindles.
